<h1>Product-Registration</h1>

<h2>
What is this? 
</h2>

<p>
Well, imagine your company produces a line of products or softwares and to ensure that people buy only legit ones, you print a serial number and it's production id, which you 
publish on blockchain but is not visible to all, one can only check if the product belongs to that list, but not vice versa. Like blockchain, every serial number is generated 
using the previous one.
</p>

<h2>
How to use?
</h2>
- Company is given option to either set pre-defined serial numbers kept in contract or a function call can generate serial numbers themselves which can be done by <br> 
# launch button <br>
- User can verify their serial number using 
# checkSerial <br>
= User can register their product by initiating a transaction using
# regWarranty
